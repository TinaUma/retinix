"""Git-diff cross-check helpers for verify cache.

v1.3.4 fix-verify-cache-relevant-files-bypass: prevent the bypass where an
agent declares `relevant_files=[docs/x.md]` while actually editing
`scripts/auth.py`. The verify cache (10-min TTL) hashes only the *declared*
files, so misreporting yielded a stale-green that skipped the security check.

This module supplies the cross-check: union files committed since the task
started + currently uncommitted, then refuse cache when the declared set is
a strict subset of the actual changes (i.e. agent under-declared).

Lives separately from `service_verification.py` for filesize gate compliance
and so the git/subprocess dependency is contained.

    Restricted to `paths` (a git pathspec) when given, else the whole tree.
    An EMPTY list is a positive fact: the scope is provably clean. Untracked
    files count (they appear as ``??``); gitignored paths do not (so `.tausik/`
    decisions and the DB never register as changes) — which is exactly right
    for qg2-cannot-close-fileless-task: a task that only wrote to the framework
    DB leaves the git scope clean.

      - git executable not found on PATH

    path fails closed on None — a declaration that git cannot back does not
    close a task (verify_scope_honesty tri-state, memory #221).

    Why `git status --porcelain` and not `changed_files_since`: the latter
    unions `git log --since=<task start>`, which sweeps in commits made by
    OTHER tasks after this one started (the release-accumulation workflow). A
    fileless task's global change-set is then never empty and it could never
    close. Porcelain judges only what is uncommitted here and now — the scope
    the closing agent is actually responsible for. `runner` is injectable for
    tests (defaults to `subprocess.run`).

    `untracked` selects git's `--untracked-files` mode, and it defaults to
    `normal` — the mode every existing caller was written against — because
    widening a shared query silently rewrites the question for all of its
    consumers (memory #286). Under `normal`, git COLLAPSES a wholly-untracked
    directory to one entry (`?? .cursor/`), so a caller asking "was any file
    under .cursor/rules/ touched?" gets `.cursor/` and answers "no". The
    `memory_route` gate needs the individual files and passes `all`; the
    fileless-close and changelog callers do not, and are unaffected.
