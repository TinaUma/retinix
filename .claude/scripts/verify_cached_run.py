    """SENAR Rule 5 cache-aware gate run.

    Returns (passed, results, cache_status) where:
      passed: bool — final gate verdict (True if cache hit OR fresh green)
      results: gate_runner result list (empty when cache hit)
      cache_status: "hit" / "miss" / "bypass" / "git-mismatch" /
                    "no-test-mapped" / "no-tests-declared" /
                    "scope-security-mismatch" / None

    `allow_handle=False` records the run exactly as usual but withholds the
    explicit state handle (v2-verify-receipt-as-argument). The one caller is the
    legacy `auto_verify` route in `gate_verify_first`, which runs these gates
    from INSIDE a `task done`: such a run must not hand out a presentable
    certificate for the very close that produced it.

    `no_tests_expected` is the caller declaring, for this run, that the
    declared files are not expected to map to any test — documentation,
    config, migrations. Without it the all-skipped run blocks, as it must;
    with it the run is recorded green with `no_tests_declared=1`. The flag
    buys visibility, not permission: the closure still happens with no
    gate executed, and the point is that this is now countable rather than
    indistinguishable from a verified one.

    `details`, when a dict is passed, is filled with what a presentation layer
    needs and the tuple cannot carry: `run_id` (for receipt lookup),
    `duration_ms`, and `cache_hit` (the reused row). An out-parameter rather
    than a wider return type so the CLI could stop duplicating this function
    without touching its ~30 existing call sites.

    On a cache miss this records the run on green so future calls can hit.
    Security-sensitive file sets bypass the cache (always re-verify).
    `append_notes_fn(slug, msg)` is called once with a one-line summary so
    the caller does not need to know cache details.

    `task_created_at` (v1.3.4): when provided, the cache lookup is also
    gated on the declared-vs-git comparison — if the agent declared a strict
    subset of files actually changed since task start (per `git log --since`
    + `git diff HEAD`), the cache is refused (status "git-mismatch") to
    prevent the bypass where a misreported file scope masks a
    security-sensitive change. None or empty falls back to the pre-v1.3.4
    behavior (security-only bypass).

    l26-verify-git-diff-wire changed what happens to that comparison after
    the cache decision. It used to be discarded; it is now recorded on the
    verification_runs row and signed into the receipt, so a proof states
    whether its own coverage was known to be complete. Divergence still does
    NOT block (Decision #138 — it fires on nearly every honest closure). The
    one exception is an undeclared file that is security-sensitive: the
    scoped gates would run against the declared list and verify it with
    nothing, so that returns "scope-security-mismatch" and fails.

    Concurrency note: two simultaneous `task done` calls for the same slug
    both miss cache, both run gates, both `record_run`. SQLite WAL keeps this
    safe (no corruption); the cost is duplicate `verification_runs` rows and
    redundant gate work. Accepted: blocking with BEGIN IMMEDIATE for the
    full gate-run window would lock the DB for the entire pytest duration,
    which is worse than the duplicate-row cost.
