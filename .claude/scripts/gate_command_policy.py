"""Security policy for custom gate commands declared in ``.tausik/config.json``.

A custom gate is a shell command the framework runs on the developer's machine,
declared in a file that travels with the repository. The policy here is the
only thing standing between that and arbitrary execution: the executable must
be on an allow-list, and shell chaining/substitution is refused outright.

Split out of ``project_config`` when that module crossed the 400-line cap; the
public names are re-exported there, so existing imports keep working.
