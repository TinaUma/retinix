"""SQLite schema initialization & migration runner — extracted from
project_backend.py (`v14b-project-backend-debt-paydown`).

`init_schema(conn)` does the full DDL bootstrap path: skip when the meta
table already records the current schema version, raise on a newer DB,
otherwise run SCHEMA_SQL + FTS_SQL + FTS_TRIGGERS_SQL + INDEXES_SQL and
record the version. On a stale-but-compatible version it backs up the
DB file (idempotent — ``.bak.v<old>``) and runs `run_migrations`, then
rebuilds the FTS indexes. Behaviour is byte-for-byte identical to the
prior `SQLiteBackend._init_schema` method.
