"""TAUSIK filesize gate — line-cap enforcement with exempt dirs/basenames.

Extracted from gate_runner.py for filesize compliance (gate_runner sat exactly
at the 400-line cap, so any addition broke it). gate_runner re-exports
``count_lines`` and ``run_filesize_gate`` so existing imports (tests, the
run_gates dispatch) keep working unchanged.

Cap history (task l26-filesize-gate-revisit, decision #190): the 400 cap was
deforming architecture — an audit found ~30 modules that document themselves as
split *only* to pass the gate, and five core files written to exactly 400 lines
("письмо под лимит, не под концепт"). The interim measure raises the cap to 500
(absorbs every documented wrapper-merge with margin while a genuinely 2× file
still blocks); the real fix (measure post-MRO public class surface instead of
raw lines, and de-exempt harness/claude/mcp/) is deferred to a dedicated task.

Exempt dirs/basenames are read from the COMMITTED, branch-coupled
``tausik/gates.json`` (survives a fresh clone, unlike gitignored
``.tausik/config.json``) and MERGED over the hardcoded fallbacks below, so
adding an exemption no longer requires editing this source file.
