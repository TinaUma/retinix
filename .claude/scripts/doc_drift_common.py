"""Shared constants + helpers for the doc-drift scanners and their auto-fixer.

Split out of doc_drift_scanners.py so the scanner module and the auto-fix module
(doc_drift_fixes.py) can both depend on one copy of the regex table and the
line-preserving text helpers without a circular import. Dependency direction is
one-way: doc_drift_scanners → doc_drift_common, doc_drift_fixes → doc_drift_common
(fixes never imports scanners; scanners re-exports write_cross_file_fixes at its
own module bottom, which is safe because common has no back-edge to either).

Covered drift classes (see the scanners for the walking logic):
  - version refs (`vX.Y` / `vX.Y.Z`) vs `tausik_version`
  - MCP tool counts (`**N tools**`, `N project tools`, brain header, pair)
  - test counts (badge URL/label, `pytest suite (N tests)`, `**N tests**`)
  - repo-state counts (stacks / hooks / review agents)
