"""Continuous-CHANGELOG gate (QG-2) — changelog-continuous-gate.

Decision #161 / convention #275: every 1.8 task updates CHANGELOG.md and its
mirror CHANGELOG.ru.md at close. That discipline lived only as a line in each
task's acceptance_criteria — reviewable, but not mechanical. This gate makes it
mechanically un-skippable: at `task done`, git must show uncommitted changes in
EACH configured changelog file, or the close is blocked (fail-closed, by the
whole-tree-proof pattern of Decision #157 — a claim git cannot back never
closes a task).

MECHANISM GENERIC, POLICY CONFIGURED. TAUSIK is a framework other projects
bootstrap; hardcoding "both a Russian and English changelog must change" would
permanently block any project that keeps no changelog, or one language only.
So the requirement is read from config:

    config.task_done.changelog_gate = {
        "enabled": true,                              # default: false (opt-in)
        "files": ["CHANGELOG.md", "CHANGELOG.ru.md"]  # all must have a diff
    }

Disabled by default — a fresh project is not forced into a discipline it never
adopted. TAUSIK's own `.tausik/config.json` turns it on with both files.

Honest exceptions (docs, cleanup, measurement — a task that legitimately
changes no behaviour) close with `task done --no-changelog`, which logs an
explicit supervision-bypass event (no silent skip — l26-bypass-telemetry).
Fileless tasks (`--no-file-changes`) never reach this gate: `_run_quality_gates_report`
returns before it for that path, and a task that touched no files could carry
no changelog diff anyway.

    `cfg`, when supplied, is an already-loaded config layer and `tausik_dir` is
    then irrelevant. That parameter exists so this stays the ONE function that
    answers "what is this gate's policy": `gate_post_scope` now decides whether
    to invoke the gate at all, and if it consulted a second reader the two could
    disagree — the gate would be listed as enabled and never run, or the reverse.
    That is the exact defect class this whole task exists to remove, so it must
    not be reintroduced one layer down.

    `tausik_dir` selects WHOSE config is read. A gate holding a project handle
    must not resolve policy from the ambient cwd (memory #265, defect
    `mcp-config-read-paths`): an MCP server launched elsewhere would otherwise
    judge this project by another project's config.

    Three outcomes, deliberately distinct:

    * NOT CONFIGURED — no `changelog_gate` block, or the config layer has no
      `task_done` at all. The gate is opt-in; a project that never adopted it
      is not nagged. → (False, [], None)
    * CONFIGURED AND VALID → (enabled, files, None). `enabled` is type-checked,
      not truthy-coerced: a hand-edited JSON string `"false"` must not read as
      True (`bool("false")` is True), which would turn the gate ON against the
      author's intent and block every future `task done`.
    * CONFIGURED AND MALFORMED — the block exists but its shape is wrong (not
      an object, `enabled` not a boolean, `files` present but not a list of
      strings), or the config could not be loaded at all. This is the case the
      first cut got wrong: it fell open, justified by a `tausik doctor` check
      that does not exist, so a typo like `{"enable": true}` silently and
      permanently disabled a policy the project believes is enforced. A stated
      intent that cannot be read is UNKNOWN, not "off" → the error is returned
      and the caller fails closed (Decision #157).
