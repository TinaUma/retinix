"""PreToolUse hook: block git push without an explicit, single-use ticket.

The agent should use /ship or /commit, which (after user "y" confirmation)
run `tausik push-ok && git push`. `tausik push-ok` writes a 60-second TTL
ticket at `.tausik/.push_ticket.json`, bound to the current HEAD SHA and
branch. This hook consumes the ticket on a valid match and allows the push;
otherwise it blocks.

Why a ticket file instead of an env flag — Claude Code, Cursor and Qwen Code
all run PreToolUse hooks in the harness process, not the Bash subprocess.
Inline `VAR=val git push` env never reaches the hook, so the historical
TAUSIK_ALLOW_PUSH path was broken in every IDE. A file-based ticket works
identically across all of them.

Single-use + short TTL + bound-to-HEAD reduce the accidental-push risk
window. Determined agents can still call `tausik push-ok` themselves; the
ticket is a discipline rail, not a malicious-agent firewall — that role
belongs to `bash_firewall.py` (force-push to main) and IDE permissions.

Env knobs:
- TAUSIK_SKIP_PUSH_HOOK=1 — debug bypass (CI / local debugging only).
- TAUSIK_PUSH_TICKET_PATH — override ticket file location (tests).

Exit codes: 0 = allow, 2 = block.

    Primary: tokenize in the dialect `tool_name` speaks, and look for
    ``git ... push`` in command position. Fallback: if that dialect cannot read
    the line (unbalanced quotes), use the substring regex — conservative, since
    a real push must not slip through on a parse failure.

    The dialect follows the TOOL. An earlier version of this fix tried both
    tokenizers and blocked if either saw a push — sound against evasion, wrong
    in practice. `shlex(posix=True)` does not know a PowerShell here-string,
    breaks out of it at the first apostrophe, and then reads the `git push` in
    a commit message's PROSE as a command; of two judges, the one that cannot
    read the language wins every disagreement. It blocked an ordinary
    `git commit -m @'…'@` — and this gate is a discipline rail, not the
    malicious-agent firewall (that is `bash_firewall`, which catches force-push
    on both channels independently). A false block here costs more than a miss.

    Residual, stated rather than assumed: a push inside a WRAPPER payload
    (`powershell -Command 'git push'`) is one quoted token to its dialect and
    is not seen here. `bash_firewall` does descend into wrapper payloads, so a
    force-push that way is still caught; an ordinary push that way is not
    ticketed. Named in `docs/*/enforcement-coverage.md` — silence about it is
    what produced the task this gate was changed for.
