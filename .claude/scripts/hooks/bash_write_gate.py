"""PreToolUse hook: extend QG-0 + scope-ACL enforcement to Bash file writes.

l26-hook-contract-review (Decision #162). The load-bearing hole: task_gate
(QG-0 "no code without a task") and scope_write_gate (SENAR Rule 2 ACL) are
wired only on Write|Edit|MultiEdit. A Bash command that writes a file — a
`cat > f <<EOF` heredoc, `sed -i`, `tee`, `dd of=`, `python -c "open(f,'w')"` —
reached neither gate, so the exact content Write refuses lands unchecked. This
was demonstrated live twice (sessions #117, #118): the same file, blocked via
Write, created via a Bash heredoc without a single objection.

This gate parses a Bash command for its write TARGETS (see `bash_write_parse`),
resolves each to a project-relative path, and applies the SAME QG-0 + scope
decision the Write gates apply — by importing THEIR functions (scope_write_gate),
not by re-deriving the rule. A second copy of the rule would drift from the
first (conv #266: judge with the real producer, not a second copy).

Residual boundary — documented in docs/ru/agent-contract.md (AC2): obfuscated
writes are NOT caught — a path built in a shell variable, `base64 -d | sh`, a
writer hidden behind a wrapper (`sudo tee`), arbitrary interpreter code beyond
a literal `open(...)`. Shell is Turing-complete; a total gate is impossible.
AC2 permits "close it OR document the boundary explicitly"; only silence is
forbidden. This raises the bar from "trivially bypass with a heredoc" to "must
actively obfuscate", and names what remains.

Exit codes: 0 = allow, 2 = block. Skipped via TAUSIK_SKIP_HOOKS=1.
