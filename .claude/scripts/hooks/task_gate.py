"""PreToolUse hook: block Write/Edit if no active task in TAUSIK.

v1.4: direct SQLite SELECT replaces the previous subprocess + 5s timeout
shape. Two reasons:

  1. **Speed.** A subprocess CLI call costs 100-300 ms per Write/Edit on
     Windows; pure SQLite query is sub-millisecond. Editor-heavy sessions
     used to feel sluggish.
  2. **Reliability.** A subprocess that fails (PowerShell quirk, locked
     venv, transient OSError) used to silently let edits through —
     fail-open. The new path keeps that fail-open as DEFAULT (so `tausik
     doctor` issues never brick a project) but adds an explicit
     `TAUSIK_HOOK_FAIL_SECURE=1` opt-in: under that flag, any DB error
     blocks the write instead of allowing it. Recommended for shared/CI
     contexts where silent bypass is unacceptable.

Exit codes: 0 = allow, 2 = block.

Receives JSON on stdin with tool_name, tool_input. `tool_input.file_path` is
read to decide JURISDICTION: an edit landing outside this project is allowed
without a task here, because this gate has no authority over another
repository. Everything it cannot classify stays gated — see
`target_is_outside_project`. (Until v1.8 this docstring promised the stdin read
while the code never performed it, and the gate blocked cross-repository edits.)

Skipped via TAUSIK_SKIP_HOOKS=1 env var.

    An agent often has more than one repository open. The gate's warrant is
    "no code without a task IN THIS PROJECT"; it has no standing over a file in
    someone else's repository, does not know their tasks, and cannot judge their
    discipline. Refusing there leaves an agent with a choice between abandoning
    legitimate work and opening a FICTITIOUS task here to unblock an edit
    elsewhere — and a gate that is profitable to fake is a gate that gets faked,
    after which it stops protecting this project too.

    FAIL-CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION. Every uncertain case returns False, which means
    "keep gating": unparseable stdin, absent tool_input, a missing or non-string
    path, or any path arithmetic that raises. The loosening applies only to a
    target proven to sit outside, never to one merely not proven inside.

    Containment is decided on realpath via commonpath, NOT startswith: with a
    plain prefix test a sibling directory sharing a prefix (``…/core-old`` next
    to ``…/core``) reads as inside, and a symlink pointing from outside into the
    project reads as outside — each the wrong answer in the dangerous direction.
