"""Bash write-target parser for `bash_write_gate` (l26-hook-contract-review).

Pure, side-effect-free parsing: given a Bash command string, return the file
paths it appears to write. Split out of `bash_write_gate.py` for the filesize
gate — the enforcement/DB half lives there, the command-parsing half here.

`write_targets(command)` is the public entry point. Everything else is a
best-effort detector for one write vector (redirection, tee, dd, sed -i, cp/mv,
curl/wget/tar/unzip, a literal open() in an interpreter payload). The documented
residual boundary (obfuscation, computed paths) lives in docs/ru/agent-contract.md.
