"""Bootstrap-drift gate runner — fails task-done when a source edit did not
reach the executable copy that actually runs.

The framework's runtime is the DEPLOYED profiles (.claude/, .cursor/, …), not
`scripts/` source: hooks and the MCP server load from a profile, while the test
suite imports from source (`pythonpath=["scripts"]`). So a hook or gate edit can
pass a fully green run and never take effect — green where it is checked, stale
where it runs. This is the release-1.8 thesis (memory #229): the guard exists
for the SINCERE agent who believes a fix landed, not for a liar.

Deliberately FAILS rather than auto-redeploying. A gate that rebuilt the copies
it evaluates would be mutating the state it judges — the exact defect class found
in `_handle_gate_toggle` this same cycle (an operation declared a check,
executed as a write). An edit that did not reach the running copy has NOT taken
effect, and blocking its closure is correct; the fix is one named command.

Extracted to its own module (gate_renar_drift pattern) so gate_runner stays
under the filesize cap.
