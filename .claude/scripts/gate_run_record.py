"""Persist one row per gate execution (l26-gate-results-persist).

Deliberately does NOT commit. The caller inserts the verification_runs row,
passes the fresh row id here, and commits once — so a run and the gate results
that justify it land together or not at all. A verification_runs row whose gate
rows silently failed to write would be a claim with no evidence behind it,
which is the failure mode this table exists to remove.

For the same reason nothing here is best-effort: a write that cannot happen
raises, and the caller's transaction takes the whole run down with it
(convention #221 — a check that cannot record its result must not report
success). Losing one verify run is cheap; a run that looks recorded but is not
is expensive, because it is indistinguishable from a real one afterwards.
