"""Wall-clock bound around the whole gate cycle (v14-verify-pipeline-envelope-timeout).

Extracted from `verify_cached_run.py` when that file crossed the 400-line
filesize gate. The cut follows a responsibility boundary rather than
convenience: everything here answers "run this with a time limit and fail
legibly if it overruns", and none of it knows anything about the verify cache,
declared scope or `verification_runs`. `verify_cached_run` re-exports the
public names, so `service_verification` and existing tests keep importing them
unchanged.

The bound covers the ENTIRE `run_gates` cycle, not each gate. Its purpose is
not to make gates fast — it is to keep a misconfigured or hanging gate from
making `task done` look like the agent froze, which on an interactive MCP host
is indistinguishable from a crash and provokes exactly the wrong recovery.
