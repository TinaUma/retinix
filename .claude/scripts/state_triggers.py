"""Lifecycle triggers for the git-native projection (state-git-triggers).

Ties export/import to the lifecycle so the `tausik/` files track the DB without
manual commands: a durable write incrementally re-serializes JUST the entity that
changed, and session start detects a tree that diverged from the DB (after a
`git pull`) and suggests `tausik sync`.

"A durable write" means EVERY mutation of the five projected kinds
(`state_import.ENTITY_DIRS`), not a chosen few. This once read "task done /
decide / memory add" and the code matched that prose: 18 of ~20 mutating service
methods never exported, so a decision recorded WITH a task_slug — the common
case — reached the DB and never the tree. A periodic full `tausik state export`
papered over it, which is why `status` reported no divergence. The property that
must hold is checked by test, not by counting call sites:
`build_tree(db)` == the tree on disk, after any sequence of mutations, with no
manual command in between.

FAIL-OPEN by construction (gotcha #271): every trigger swallows its own errors —
a serialization or IO fault must NEVER break or roll back the underlying
operation. The projection is best-effort; the DB write is the source of truth.

Gated behind config `state.auto_export` (default OFF): until
state-git-roundtrip-gate un-gitignores `tausik/`, a project must opt in so it
never gets surprise untracked files.

    Asked as a QUESTION OF THE DATA — "which live edges now point outside the

    because after a DELETE the departed row's id is no longer recoverable from
    its slug. One consequence of that form is real: an edge orphaned by any
    means, past or future, is picked up on the next departure, without anyone
    having to have routed it here.

    IT DOES NOT CONVERGE, and this used to be called "self-healing", which reads
    as if it did. Re-serializing the SOURCE does not touch `memory_edges`, so the
    predicate this scan runs on never clears: the same orphans are found, and
    the same files re-rendered, on every subsequent departure, forever.

    MEASURED, so the cost is a number and not a worry — 2000 memory rows, 40
    orphaned edges, three consecutive sweeps:

        sweep #1: returned=40  export_one=40  47ms   orphans_left=40
        sweep #2: returned=0   export_one=40  281ms  orphans_left=40
        sweep #3: returned=0   export_one=40  16ms   orphans_left=40

    `returned=0` with `export_one=40` is the whole defect in one line: forty
    serializations that changed nothing. It is bounded by the ORPHAN count, not
    by tree size, but archived memory only ever grows, so the per-departure bill
    grows monotonically with it.

    Converging means invalidating the edge (`valid_to`) when its target leaves —
    and that belongs at the SERVICE layer, where the archive or the delete
    happens, not in a fail-open projection trigger that would then be writing to
    the database it is downstream of. Tracked as
    `orphaned-edges-never-converge-so-every-departure-pays-for-them`; deliberately
    not smuggled in here.

    `memory_edges` is polymorphic (`source_type`/`target_type` instead of a
    foreign key), so `_projection_victims` — which reads PRAGMA foreign_key_list
    — is structurally unable to see this dependency. It is real regardless of
    whether the schema can express it, which is why it is followed by hand here

    ONLY the manual service-layer calls silenced and this hook fully alive, the
    projection property goes red on all six seeds
    (`test_the_hook_alone_does_not_carry_the_projection`).

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, by name, so no one has to rediscover it:
      * every INSERT — `_ins` takes raw SQL and knows neither table nor slug, so
        epic_add / story_add / task_add / decision_add / memory_add reach the DB
        and not the tree;
      * `memory` and `decisions` as kinds — their projected files are keyed by
        row id, not by a slug column, and `memory_delete` is a raw `_ex`;
      * the budget setters (`task_set_call_budget`, `task_set_cost_budget`,
        `task_set_token_budget`, the `*_actual` writers) — raw `_ex` on tasks,
        writing the PROJECTED columns `call_budget` and `tier`;
      * `task_append_notes` and `task_claim` — raw `_ex`;
      * the bulk `UPDATE memory SET archived_at` in `backend_graph`.

    SO WHO GUARANTEES COVERAGE? Not this hook, and not the ~18 manual
    `auto_export_entity` / `auto_export_by_id` calls in the service layer either.
    Both are implementations. The guarantee is the PROPERTY — after any sequence
    of mutations with no manual command in between, the tree equals
    `build_tree(db)` — checked on generated sequences with a write-path ratchet
    (`tests/test_state_projection_tracks_db.py`). Adding a mutator means adding
    it to that test's operation set; the ratchet then tells you whether you
    introduced a write path nobody accounted for. That is one answer to "is my
    new mutator covered", and it is the only one that is true.

    The manual calls therefore STAY. Removing them as redundant is what this
    docstring used to invite, and it would silently break the projection for
    every kind listed above. Completing the hook is real work — it means giving
    `_ins` a table and a slug at every call site, moving the raw `_ex` writers
    onto `_update`, and resolving ids for the bulk archive — and it is tracked
    as `v2-projection-hook-covers-every-write`, not pretended to be done here.
