"""Does an AC evidence citation name a real test — and where does `tests/` live?

Split out of `gate_ac_check` for the 400-line cap, along the seam its own review
exposed. "Has this criterion got evidence?" and "is this citation real?" are
different questions, and every defect found in the first version of the Rule 5
rewrite was in the second one: the `::name` was never looked at, `..` escaped the
test tree, a bare basename matched anything, and the root came from the process
cwd rather than from the project. Keeping them apart means the next change to
the gate does not have to re-read the path rules to be safe.

    the citation and `cwd=scripts` did not, so a task with genuine evidence was
    hard-blocked with "a path that does not resolve is treated as no evidence at
    all" and no `task log` line could fix it. The rest of the framework is

    Fail-CLOSED: a reference that cannot be resolved does not count as evidence.
    An unresolvable citation is indistinguishable from an invented one, and this
    predicate's adversary is an agent that can write whatever it likes into its
    own notes.

    The first version checked `os.path.isfile` on the path and stopped there,
    which the review of that version defeated three ways: `tests/../scripts/
    gate_ac_check.py` escaped the test tree entirely and let the gate's OWN
    implementation file count as a test; a bare basename resolved against any of
    the ~300 files under `tests/`; and the `::name` was split off and never
    looked at, so an invented test function on a real file passed. All three are
    closed below — the path must normalise to somewhere inside `tests/`, and a
    named function must actually be defined in the file.

    What is still NOT checked, and is not claimed to be: that the test was ever
    run, that it passed, or that it has anything to do with this task. This
    predicate raises the price of a fabricated citation; it does not make one
    impossible, and an agent willing to write `def test_x(): pass` into a new
    file clears it. It is a floor, not a proof.
