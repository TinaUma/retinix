"""Under-evidenced closures require an L3 adversarial review (v15-l3-risk-trigger).

WHAT THIS GATE DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM (decision #212). It REFUSES the close and
returns; it does not merely annotate one. A refusal has to be justified, and the
justification here is NOT that the score predicts anything — the backtest in
docs/ru/research/risk-model-backtest-2026-07.md measured AUC 0.4820 over 374
closures, i.e. the composite does not separate closures a defect escaped from
those it did not, and its heaviest factor (`gate_coverage`, weight 0.25) is
significantly INVERTED at AUC 0.409, p = 0.0098.

What `measured_score >= LEVEL_HIGH` over a real coverage share does say is a
DESCRIPTION, true by construction and independent of any AUC: most of the
evidence factors we were able to measure are at or near their worst value —
gates unverified, tests untouched under churn, acceptance criteria with no
evidence markers, security surface touched. "We have almost no evidence this
close was verified" is a legitimate reason to ask for a second pair of eyes on
its own terms. It is not a forecast, and the wording below no longer implies one.

The honest gap, stated rather than papered over: the SELECTOR is still the
a-priori weighting nobody validated, so which closures land above the line is
not evidence-based. Fixing that needs a held-out sample the project does not yet
have (the backtest refused to re-weight on the same 374 rows for exactly this
reason). Until then this gate is a policy on evidence, not a risk model.

Walko HITL-for-1% pattern: instead of one review policy for everything,
escalate only the thinnest-evidenced closures — the ~1% where an adversarial
pass pays for itself. Two deliberate softeners:

  - Renormalized measured score: factors the collector could not measure
    are excluded (they already push the STORED score up conservatively).
    Escalating on absence-of-measurement would block every close on
    keyless / no-verify-gate projects — punishment for adoption, not risk.
  - Minimum measurement coverage: escalation needs MIN_MEASURED_WEIGHT
    of the model by weight actually measured (0.75 = at least four of
    the five factors). Thinner subsets — {ac_evidence, code_churn} at
    0.35, or {test_delta, ac_evidence, security} at 0.60 — read high on
    every casual close (source-only files, no evidence markers yet),
    which is routine work, not "the critical 1%". The 0.60 case was a
    live boundary flake at exactly 0.6667 in the full test suite.
  - Opt-out: config risk.l3_block_on_high=false downgrades to a warning.

A recorded L3 review for the task (tausik review record --type L3)
satisfies the gate.

Lowercase run_type CANNOT reach the DB: argparse pins --type to
choices=['L1','L2','L3'] and the reviews schema carries
CHECK(run_type IN ('L1','L2','L3')). The UPPER() in has_l3_review is
belt-and-braces for hand-written rows, not a supported input form —
the previous wording promised a `--run-type l3` flag that does not
exist, and its test only passed because the fixture declared reviews
by hand WITHOUT the CHECK (test-ddl-drift-verification-runs).
