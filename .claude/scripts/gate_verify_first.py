"""Verify-First Contract enforcement (QG-2) — extracted from `service_gates`.

Same split as `gate_qg0_check` / `gate_ac_check`: the policy is a free
function, the mixin keeps only the thin delegation. Extracted when
verify-cache-empty-scope-hit pushed `service_gates.py` past the 400-line
filesize gate — the alternative was an exemption entry, which would have
silenced the gate rather than answered it.

Takes the service (`svc`), not its backend, so `svc.be` is resolved only where
it is actually used. The config-load path fails closed and returns before any
backend access, and callers may legitimately pass a service with no backend
wired — `test_config_trust` constructs a bare mixin to assert exactly that
fail-closed return. Passing `self.be` at the call site turned that guarantee
into an AttributeError; the extraction has to keep the access as lazy as the
original method had it.

    Three opt-out paths:
      - config.task_done.auto_verify = true  →  legacy inline behavior;
        in that case we run the verify-trigger gates inline right here.
      - No verify-trigger gates configured (small projects, no pytest
        etc.) →  nothing to wait on, skip enforcement.
      - Security-sensitive files →  cache always refused, but we still
        require an explicit verify run; the agent must call `tausik
        verify` immediately before `task done` to avoid stale greens.

    `no_file_changes` (qg2-cannot-close-fileless-task) selects the THIRD
    scope state: the caller declares this task touched no files. Unlike the
    two states this contract had — declared and undeclared — this one is
    provable, and the proof is git's, not the agent's word: the declared
    scope (relevant_files as a pathspec, or the whole tree when empty) must
    have NO uncommitted changes. A dirty scope or an unavailable git blocks,
    fail-closed. This is symmetric to how no_tests_declared closes a run with
    no gate executed — here we close with no scope to gate.

    `verify_handle` (v2-verify-receipt-as-argument, SEP-2567) is the FOURTH
    route and takes precedence over the freshness lookup: the caller presents
    the identifier `tausik verify` minted, and it is validated by point lookup
    plus re-derivation from live state instead of being searched for by age.
    Its refusals are substantive ("the files this receipt covers have changed")
    where the lookup could only ever say "miss".

    Presenting no handle keeps the previous behaviour exactly (AC8). That is a
    compatibility promise rather than an oversight: a silent tightening would
    strand every existing caller, and the handle is a better way to PRESENT a
    green, not a new thing to be green about.
