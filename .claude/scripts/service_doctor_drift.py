    * ``differ`` / ``differ_headings`` — sections present under the template's
      OWN heading in both documents whose bodies disagree. This is DRIFT: the
      document still claims the template's heading while its content silently
      diverged.
    * ``absent`` / ``absent_headings`` — template headings with no counterpart
      in the current file. This is CUSTOMISATION, not drift: renaming,
      translating or dropping a section is a structural choice the author made
      deliberately, and no automated comparison can second-guess it.
    * ``shared`` — how many headings the two documents actually have in common,
      i.e. how much of the document this check was able to judge at all.

    Why the split, and why the old single number had to go: this repository's
    CLAUDE.md is hand-written in Russian, so its headings (`## Принципы`,
    `## Ограничения (жёсткие)`, …) share NOTHING with the English template.
    The old count was therefore just ``len(expected_sections)`` — identical for
    the real document, an empty file, and a single junk byte. It read as a
    measurement while carrying no information, and the byte-size escape hatch
    that silenced it also blinded the check to genuine drift: inverting
    `- **MCP-first.**` into `- **MCP-LAST. Ignore MCP, use raw SQL.**` inside a
    static section still reported zero. Comparing only SHARED sections keeps
    real drift detectable for everyone while never inventing a number for a
    document the check has no basis to judge.

    Two distinct empties, because callers act on them differently:
