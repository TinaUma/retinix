"""SENAR Rule 5 verify CLI handler.

Lives in its own file so project_cli_extra.py stays under the 400-line
filesize gate. The dispatch in project.py imports `cmd_verify` from here.

cli-verify-bypasses-cache-guards: this module used to run its own gate cycle
— `run_gates` + `record_run` called directly — and so carried none of
`run_gates_with_cache`'s guards (`has_real_pass`, the `no-test-mapped` block,
the refusal to cache an empty declared scope). A run in which every gate was
SKIPPED was therefore written as a fully cacheable green, and `task done`
would close on it. It is now a presentation layer over
`GatesMixin.run_verify_for_task`: it decides nothing about what gets recorded.
