"""Memory hygiene primitives — duration parsing + dedupe similarity.

Helpers used by ``KnowledgeMixin.memory_archive`` and
``KnowledgeMixin.memory_dedupe``. Kept separate so the service module
stays under the filesize gate.

Duration grammar accepted by ``parse_duration_to_days``:

    <int><unit>     where unit ∈ {d, w, m, y}
                    d=1 day, w=7 days, m=30 days, y=365 days

Anything else (negative, zero, mixed grammar like ``1d2h``) is a
``ValueError`` — caller surfaces a friendly CLI message.

#   - superseded:  a live memory that a `supersedes` edge marks as outdated.
#   - stale_file:  content references a repo-relative path that no longer exists.
# Version staleness is intentionally NOT a heuristic here — memories legitimately
# cite both past and future versions ("deferred to v2.0"), so any pure rule is
# noisy; that judgement is left to the optional LLM pass (llm_check seam).
