"""Trust tiers for TAUSIK configuration — a project may only TIGHTEN enforcement.

``.tausik/config.json`` is an ordinary file inside the repository, and the
enforcement switches used to live in it: ``qg0.scope_hard_gate``,
``risk.l3_block_on_high``, ``task_done.auto_verify``, and per-gate ``enabled``,
``severity``, ``trigger`` and ``file_extensions``. An agent — or anyone opening
a pull request — could disable its own supervision with one write to a tracked
file. The premise was already recorded in one spot (``bootstrap_opencode.py``:
*".tausik/config.json travels with the repo, so the override is UNTRUSTED"*);
this module generalizes it.

THE RULE. Config is read from three tiers, least to most trusted: project
(``.tausik/config.json``, travels with the repo), user (``~/.tausik/config.json``),
managed (``$TAUSIK_MANAGED_CONFIG``). Higher tiers win on merge, EXCEPT that on a
guarded key the stricter value wins in both directions — a project may tighten
freely and may not weaken, and a tightening it already earned is not undone by a
trusted tier that merely restates a default.

Guarding ``enabled`` alone would be decorative: a gate that keeps its switch on
while losing every trigger never fires, and one whose ``file_extensions`` is
narrowed to nothing never receives input. Both are "off" spelled differently, so
those keys are guarded as sets the project may extend but not shrink.

THREAT SURFACE. Closed: **a repository cannot grant itself authority.**
``.tausik/config.json`` arrives with every clone, fork and PR;
``~/.tausik/config.json`` does not. NOT closed, stated plainly rather than
implied: an agent that can run shell commands can write the user tier or export
``TAUSIK_MANAGED_CONFIG`` itself. Tiers are **not a sandbox**. What they buy is a
raised bar and, above all, visibility — weakening must now happen outside the
repository, so it can no longer hide in a diff that looks like a config tweak.

Deliberately unguarded (decision #137): ``gates.filesize.exempt_files`` and
``verify_cache_ttl_seconds`` scope or tune supervision rather than switch it off.
Still open and named rather than implied: a gate ``command`` can be reduced to an
ALLOWED but inert one (``l26-gate-command-neutering``).

Full rationale, migration notes and the reader/writer contract:
``docs/en/config-trust-tiers.md``.
