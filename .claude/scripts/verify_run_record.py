Extracted from service_verification.py for filesize-gate compliance when
l26-verify-git-diff-wire added the declared-scope columns. Follows the same
pattern as verify_cache.py / verify_files_hash.py: the logic lives here,
`service_verification` re-exports it, and every existing caller

unchanged.

`_utcnow_iso` is defined locally rather than imported back from

    With `gate_results` and a `task_slug`, also emits a signed receipt into
    the row's receipt_json (v15-receipt-emit-on-verify). Emission is
    best-effort: no project key / signing failure never breaks the run
    record. `project_dir` defaults to the current working directory (the
    CLI/MCP convention for key lookup).

    `scope_description` (l26-verify-git-diff-wire) is the dict from
    `verify_scope_honesty.describe_declared_scope`. It is persisted on the row
    AND signed into the receipt, so the proof states whether its own scope was
    known to be complete. Omitting it records "unknown" — never "complete":
    a caller that did not measure must not be able to claim full coverage by
    saying nothing.

    `no_tests_declared` (verify-no-test-mapped-dead-end) marks a run that
    passed with NO gate executed because the caller declared none was expected.
    It is a column rather than a `scope` value: `scope` is CHECK-constrained to
    the SENAR tiers, so encoding it there raised IntegrityError against every
    real database while passing in tests whose DDL omits the constraint.

    `handle_out` (v2-verify-receipt-as-argument), when a dict is passed, is
    filled with `{"handle", "expires_at"}` for a run entitled to one. An
    out-parameter for the same reason `details` is one in
    `run_gates_with_cache`: this function has many call sites and returns an
    int several of them use directly.

    `allow_handle=False` withdraws entitlement regardless of the four
    conditions below. It exists for ONE caller: the legacy `auto_verify` route,
    which runs the verify-trigger gates INLINE from inside `task done`. Those
    runs are recorded with `trigger=verify` so they share the cache bucket, and
    without this flag every such close would mint a real, hour-long, presentable
    handle as a side effect — including closes that then BLOCK for an unrelated
    reason, leaving a valid handle for a task that never closed. The invariant
    "a close cannot certify itself" was previously carried by the trigger label
    alone; the label is still needed for the cache, so the entitlement says so
    separately.

    ENTITLEMENT IS NARROW, deliberately. A handle is minted only for a run that
    is green, names a task, names files, and is NOT stamped `noncacheable|` —
    the same four conditions under which the old freshness lookup would have
    accepted the row. The handle changes HOW a green is presented, not WHICH
    greens count. A run that certifies nothing is still recorded (that is
    observability, and it is why the recording is unconditional), it just
    cannot be handed out.
